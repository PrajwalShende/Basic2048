# Basic2048
This is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 puzzle game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game ends when there are no more valid moves possible or when the player reaches the 2048 tile.
The game keeps track of your score, which is the total sum of all merged tiles.
Try to reach the highest score possible by making strategic moves and combining tiles.
The original 2048 game was created by Gabriele Cirulli. This implementation is inspired by the original game's concept.
